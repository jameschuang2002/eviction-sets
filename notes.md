# How to launch the attack?

### Setup
1. If you just restarted / turn on your computer, check if you have huge pages set up 

```
grep -i huge /proc/meminfo
```

2. If you do not, set up huge pages 

```echo NUM_PAGES | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages```

3. Find the virtual address of kbd_keycode in your system and copy the address to v2p_kernel/v2p.c and replace the value in my_module_init, func_addr

```sudo cat /proc/kallsyms | grep kbd_keycode```

4. Convert the virtual address to physical address using the kernel module

```sudo insmod v2p.ko```

If your system shows a warning referring to certificates not being signed, please go into bios and enter insecure mode 

5. View the physical address 
```sudo dmesg```

6. Copy the physical address to replace the address in src/test.c KBD_KEYCODE

### Profiling

1. Compile the code 

``` ./compile.sh ```

2. Run the code 

```
sudo ./bin/test.out
```

3. Please start typing once the screen shows ready for prime+probe, if you started early, it may cause the eviction search algorithm to fail due to external noise. 

# Critical 
1. Overlapping bits modified to 12 for huge pages instead of 6 in regualr pages

# Huge Pages

Setting up large pages
```echo NUM_PAGES | sudo tee /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages```

Check if pages are allocated
```grep -i huge /proc/meminfo```

#Isolate CPU 
1. GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="isolcpus=1,2" 
2. sudo update-grub; 
3. sudo reboot 
4. cat /proc/cmdline

#Create CPU set
```sudo cset shield --cpu=0 --kthread=on```

#Run on CPU set
```sudo cset shield --exec ./your_program```

#Disable Prefetchers: 
### **1. Install the `msr-tools` Package**
On Linux, you need the `msr-tools` package to read and write MSRs.

#### For Debian/Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install msr-tools
```

#### For RHEL/CentOS/Fedora:
```bash
sudo yum install msr-tools
```

---

### **2. Load the `msr` Kernel Module**
The `msr` kernel module must be loaded to allow access to the MSRs.

```bash
sudo modprobe msr
```

To verify it is loaded:
```bash
lsmod | grep msr
```

---

### **3. Identify the MSR for Prefetch Control**
The control for hardware prefetchers is typically located in the **MSR 0x1A4** (Intel processors). The value written to this register controls the state of various prefetchers.

- **Bits to control specific prefetchers:**
  - **Bit 0**: Disable L2 hardware prefetcher.
  - **Bit 1**: Disable adjacent cache-line prefetcher.
  - **Bit 2**: Disable DCA prefetcher.
  - **Bit 3**: Disable L1 hardware prefetcher.

A value of `0xF` disables all prefetchers.

---

### **4. Write to the MSR**
You need to write the desired value to the MSR register for each CPU core. For example:

#### Disable all prefetchers (write `0xF`):
```bash
sudo wrmsr -p <CPU_ID> 0x1A4 0xF
```

- `<CPU_ID>`: The ID of the CPU core (starting from `0`). Use a loop to write to all cores.

#### Example: Disable on all cores
```bash
for cpu in $(seq 0 $(nproc --all)); do
    sudo wrmsr -p $cpu 0x1A4 0xF
done
```

#### Verify:
You can verify the setting with:
```bash
sudo rdmsr -p <CPU_ID> 0x1A4
```

---

### **5. Automate on Boot**
To apply these settings at boot:
1. Create a script to execute the commands.
2. Place the script in `/etc/init.d/` or create a systemd service.

Example script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for cpu in $(seq 0 $(nproc --all)); do
    wrmsr -p $cpu 0x1A4 0xF
done
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x /path/to/your/script.sh
```

---

### **6. Notes and Precautions**
1. **Root Permissions**: Writing to MSRs requires root access.
2. **Persistence**: Changes to MSRs are not persistent across reboots, so automation is necessary.
3. **Check CPU Documentation**: Ensure that your CPU supports MSR 0x1A4 and the specific bit settings for prefetchers. Different CPUs might use different MSRs or bit layouts.
4. **Testing**: Disabling prefetchers may degrade performance for some workloads. Test thoroughly to ensure it achieves your desired outcome.
